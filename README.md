# Ember landing page for js.org

This repository contains a minimal, single splash page used on `js.org`. 
The [js.org project](https://github.com/js-org/js.org) has landing pages
for many projects within the JavaScript ecosystem, including
other front end frameworks like [Vue](https://vue.js.org/).

This is not the main Ember website repository.
Please see [ember-learn/ember-website](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website) instead.
